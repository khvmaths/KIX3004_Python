python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. an increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents the program's semantic structure. this feature is also sometimes termed the off-side rule.
